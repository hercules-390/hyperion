/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This header is at once a part of the public header set for SoftFloat-3a For
| Hercules (S3FH) and a required component to build the S3FH static library.
| When building S3FH, this header is included by platform.h.  It is also
| included by softfloat-types.h, one of the public headers for S3FH.
|
| The base S3FH package requires stdint.h (a C99-standard header), and the
| documentation suggests altering things if SoftFloat-3a is being comiled
| on a pre-C99 system, which includes Windows systems with versions of
| Visual Studio earlier than 2015.
|
| This header includes stdbool.h and stdint.h if the respective macros
| HAVE_STDINT_H and HAVE_STDBOOL_H are defined and expects those headers
| to define the types and macros for integer, fast_integer, least_integer,
| and boolean types.
|
| If HAVE_STDBOOL_H is undefined, this header defines the needed boolean
| types and macros.
|
| If HAVE_STDINT_H is undefined, this header defines the int_fast and
| int_least macros and tests HAVE_INTTYPES_H.  If that macro is defined,
| this header #includes it, otherwise it defines the integer types required
| to build S3FH.

| The 'fast' and 'least' types defined below match those in the stdint.h
| header shipped with Debian 9.  The "normal" integer types int.._t match
| those included in hstdint.h when compiling under MSVC.  Note that while
| MSVC 2015 does include stdint.h, the Windows build for Hercules does not
| include it and instead defines its own integer types in hstdint.h.  Prior
| versions of MSVC did not include stdint.h, and no version of MSVC includes
| inttypes.h.  This means that:
|  - The 'fast' and 'least' types must match those in Windows stdint.h because
|    if Windows has stdint.h (VS 2015 or better), SoftFloat will compile with
|    MSVC stdint.h and Hercules will compile the SoftFloat public headers with
|    the definitions below.
|  - The standard integer types must match those in Hercules
