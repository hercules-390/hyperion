                         Building Hercules


If you are wanting to build the Windows version of Hercules refer to the
README.WIN64 document for detailed instructions.

As for non-Windows *nix builds, if you're simply trying to figure out how to
build Hercules from the distributed source tarball (i.e. NOT from the source
directly pulled from the repository), then skip to the "Building Hercules"
section further below.

                        -------------------
                         BUILD PREPARATION
                        -------------------


In order to build Hercules from the repository sources, you must have
installed the minimum versions of the development packages as reported
by the 'bldlvlck' script in the 'util' subdirectory:


    Note:  the below listed versions may not be correct;
           please run the 'util/bldlvlck' script for the
           most current list of minimum versions.


     Package   Version  (or greater!)
    ----------------------------------
     autoconf    2.64   (or greater!)
     automake    1.9    (or greater!)
     flex        2.5    (or greater!)
     gawk        3.0    (or greater!)
     gcc         3.0    (or greater!)
     grep        1.0    (or greater!)
     m4          1.4.6  (or greater!)
     make        3.79   (or greater!)
     perl        5.6    (or greater!)
     sed         3.02   (or greater!)


The following package(s) is(are) optional

     Package   Version  (or greater!)
    ----------------------------------
     libgcrypt   0.4.4  (or greater!)   (for z990 crypto instructions)
     zlib            ?                  (for ZLIB compression)
     libbz2          ?                  (for BZIP2 compression)


* If an optional package is not installed, the resulting build may lack
  an optional feature, but should be usable otherwise.

All of these tools can be found at www.gnu.org in source code form, and
are also widely available in packaged form (RPM, DEB, Solaris packages,
etc.).

Once you have the minimum versions of all of the above tools installed,
simply enter the following command:

    sh ./autogen.sh

This will, among other things, create you a shell script called "configure".
The resulting configure script (created by the above 'autogen' command) is
then what you use to build Hercules with. (It will probably create a bunch
of other directories and files too, but we're mostly concerned about the
configure script).

                         BUILDING HERCULES
                        -------------------


Now that a 'configure' script has been built for us, let's use it! :)

(Note: if you're simply trying to build Hercules from the distributed
tarball (i.e. NOT directly from the pulled respository sources), then just
use the 'configure' script that should have been included with the source
distribution tarball.)

    |  See also refer to instructions in the BUILD PREPARATION   |
    |  section above regarding the 'bldlvlck' script which can   |
    |  be used to check to see if you have all of the required   |
    |  packages installed or not to build Hercules from source.  |
    |                                                            |
    +------------------------------------------------------------+

Before you trying using the configure script, you may wish to review
the information in the INSTALL file. It contains generic installation
instructions for how to build/install most any package. The instructions
there pertain just as much to Hercules as they do to any other package.

Since the information there is pretty detailed however, rather than try
to slog your way through it all, you may wish to first review the below
summarized version first.

Briefly, the way you build Herc is to first "configure" the building
process and then invoke your pre-configured building process. The build
process basically consists of a 'make' command which processes a 'makefile'.
The makfile however needs to be customized for your system. That's what
the "configure" script does. It contructs a customized makefile and that
is what is meant by "configuring your building process".


Here's the entire build process step-by-step:


    To build Herc, first switch to the directory where the source files
    are and then configure the build process by entering the following
    command:

        ./configure

    (Note: you may or may not wish to enter additional parameters
    to the configure command. See further below)

    Then simply invoke your pre-configured build process by entering
    the following command:

        make

    That's it! The 'make' command should build Hercules for you. After
    it's been built, you may or may not wish to "install" it.

    To "install" Hercules into the default package installation
    directory after building it, enter the following command:

        make install

    That will copy the just built binaries to their proper place.

    To uninstall Hercules once it's been installed, simply enter the
    command:

        make uninstall

    and the previously copied files will be removed (deleted).


Note: you may or may not wish to add some additional parameters to
the above mentioned "configure" command. One of the more common ones
for those who are building Herc under Cygwin is "--enable-fthreads".
Enter "./configure --help" for more information regarding the various
parameters that Hercules's customized "configure" script supports
for building Hercules.
