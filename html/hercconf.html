<h1>Hercules Version 2: Configuration File</h1>
<p>
This page describes the configuration file for the Hercules S/370,
ESA/390, and z/Architecture emulator.
<p>
The configuration file <b><i>hercules.cnf</b></i> contains the
processor and device layout.  It is roughly equivalent to the IOCDS on
a real System/390.  The configuration file is an ASCII text file.

<h3>Comment lines</h3>
<p>
Blank lines, and lines beginning with a pound sign ('#' - "hash" to
Europeans) or an asterisk, are treated as comments.
<h3>System parameters</h3>
<p>
System parameters may appear in any order but they must precede all
device records.  Each system parameter must be on a separate line.
The following system parameters may be specified:
<dl>
<dt><code>CPUSERIAL <em>xxxxxx</em></code>
<dd>specifies the 6 hexadecimal digit CPU serial
    number stored by the STIDP instruction
<dt><code>CPUMODEL <em>xxxx</em></code>
<dd>specifies the 4 hexadecimal digit CPU model number
    stored by the STIDP instruction
<dt><code>CPUVERID <em>xx</em></code>
<dd>specifies the 2 hexadecimal digit CPU version code
    stored by the STIDP instruction.
    The default version code is FD when ARCHMODE S/370 or ARCHMODE ESA/390
    is specified.  For the ESAME architecture mode 00 is used as default.
<dt><code>MAINSIZE <em>nnnn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the main storage size in megabytes, where
    <code><em>nnnn</em></code> is a decimal number
    in the range is 2 to 1024 
<dt><code>XPNDSIZE <em>nnnn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the expanded storage size in megabytes, where
    <code><em>nnnn</em></code> is a decimal number
    in the range is 0 to 1024
<dt><code>HTTPPORT <em>nnnn</em> [AUTH/NOAUTH] <em>[userid password]</em></code>
<dd>specifies the port number (in decimal) on which the HTTP server
    will listen. The port number must either be 80
    or within the range 1024 - 65535 inclusive. If no HTTPPORT statement is
    present or an invalid port number is specified, then the HTTP server thread
    will not be activated.<br>
    <tt>AUTH</tt> indictates that a userid and password are required to access
    the HTTP server, whereas <tt>NOAUTH</tt> indicates that a userid and password
    are not required. The userid and password may be any valid string.
<dt><code>HTTPROOT <em>directory</em></code>
<dd>specifies the root directory where the HTTP server's files reside.
    If not specified, the default value for Win32 builds of Hercules is the
    directory where the Hercules executable itself is executing out of, and for
    non-Win32 builds it is the directory specified as the default package
    installation directory when the Hercules executable was built (which can
    vary depending on how the Hercules package was built, but is usually
    <tt>/usr/local/share/hercules/</tt>).<br>
    Note: Windows users of Hercules who do not have the complete Cygwin package
    installed (i.e. only have the required Cygwin DLLs installed instead)
    should specify this value in the form: "<tt>/cygdrive/x/pathname/</tt>"
    where '<tt>x</tt>' is the Windows drive letter. For example, if the Windows
    directory where the http server's files reside is
    "<tt>K:\Hercules\html\</tt>", then you should specify
    "<tt>/cygdrive/k/Hercules/html/</tt>"
    on your <tt>HTTPROOT</tt> statement.
<dt><code>SHRDPORT <em>nnnn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the port number (in decimal) on which the Shared Device server
    will listen.  Specifying SHRDPORT will allow other Hercules instances
    to access devices on this instance.  (Currently only DASD devices may
    be shared).  By default, the other Hercules instances (clients) will
    use port 3990.  If you specify a different port number, then you will
    have to specify this port number on the device statement for the other
    Hercules clients.
    If no SHRDPORT statement is present then the Shared Device server thread
    will not be activated.<br>
<dt><code>DIAG8CMD <em>disable/enable</em></code>
<dd>When set to enable, commands issued through diagnose 8 will be 
    executed by hercules as hercules commands.  When set to disable,
    commands issued through the diagnose 8 interface will be ignored.
    The default is disable.  Note that when this feature is enabled, systems
    running under hercules can even issue host commands through the hercules
    sh command.  Enabling this feature may have security consequences.
<dt><code>CNSLPORT <em>nnnn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the port number (in decimal) to which tn3270 and
    telnet clients will connect
<dd>The CNSLPORT statement may also have the form of host:port, where 
    the telnet console server will bind to the specified address.
<dt><code>NUMCPU <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the number of emulated CPUs.
    <em>Note:</em>
    Multiprocessor emulation is only available when the definition of
    the compile-time variable <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code>
    in the file <em><b>hercules.h</b></em> has a value of more than 1.
    Multiprocessor emulation works best
    if your system has more than physical CPU, but you can
    emulate multiple CPUs even on a uniprocessor system
    and you may still achieve a small performance benefit.
    There is no point in specifying NUMCPU greater than 1 unless
    your operating system is able to support multiple CPUs, and
    if you do not need multiprocessor emulation then setting
    MAX_CPU_ENGINES to 1 at compile time may improve performance.
<dt><code>NUMVEC <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the number of emulated vector facilities. Default is one per
    CPU. Only available by default in ESA/390 mode.
<dt><code>CPUPRIO <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>is only valid when Hercules is run on a *ix (Linux/Unix) host and
    specifies the priority of the CPU thread. Default is a nice value of
    15, which means a low priority such that I/O can be scheduled and
    completed in favour of CPU cycles being burned. On Multi-CPU systems,
    a real CPU can be 'dedicated' to Hercules, by giving the CPU thread a
    very high dispatching priority (-20). Note that Hercules needs to be a
    setuid root program to allow it to reset its dispatching priority to a
    high (negative) value (ie. chown root.root hercules; chmod +s hercules)
<dt><code>LOADPARM <em>xxxxxxxx</em></code>
<dd>specifies the eight-character IPL parameter which is used
    by some operating systems to select system parameters
<dt><code>SYSEPOCH <em>yyyy</em></code>
<dd>specifies the base date for the TOD clock.  Use the default
    value (1900) for all systems except OS/360.
    OS/360 expects the base date to be 1960, but specifying this
    value causes an error because OS/360 regards 2000 as an invalid
    date.  For OS/360, <code>SYSEPOCH 1988</code> is recommended.
    This makes the year 2000 appear to be 1972.
<dt><code>TZOFFSET &plusmn;<em>hhmm</em></code>
<dd>specifies the hours and minutes by which the TOD clock will
    be offset from the current system time.  For GMT, use the
    default value (0000).  For timezones west of Greenwich, specify
    a negative value (example: <code>-0500</code> for US Eastern Standard
    Time, <code>-0800</code> for US Pacific Standard Time).
    For timezones east of Greenwich, specify a positive value
    (example: <code>+0100</code> for Central European Time,
    <code>+0930</code> for South Australian Time).
<dt><code>TODDRAG <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the TOD clock drag factor.  This parameter can be used
    to slow down the TOD clock by a factor of <em>nn</em>, which can
    improve the performance of some operating systems which consume
    significant amounts of CPU time processing timer interrupts.
    <em>Use of the TODDRAG parameter is no longer recommended.</em>
<dt><code>OSTAILOR OS/390 &#124; VM &#124; VSE &#124; LINUX</code>
<dd>specifies the intended operating system.  The effect of this
    parameter is to reduce control panel message traffic by
    selectively suppressing trace messages for program checks
    which are considered normal in the specified environment.
<dt><code>PANRATE SLOW &#124 FAST &#124 <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the panel refresh rate, in milliseconds between refreshes. SLOW
    is the same as 500, and FAST is the same as 50. A value less than the
    Linux system clock tick interval (10 on Intel, 1 on Alpha), or more than
    5000, will be rejected. SLOW is the default.
<dt><code>ARCHMODE S/370 &#124 ESA/390 &#124 ESAME</code>
<dd>specifies the initial architecture mode.
    Use <code>S/370</code> for OS/360, VM/370, and MVS 3.8.
    Use <code>ESA/390</code> for MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390, VM/ESA, VSE/ESA,
    Linux/390, and ZZSA.
    Use <code>ESAME</code> for z/OS and zLinux.
    When ESAME is specified, the machine will always IPL in ESA/390 mode,
    but is capable of being switched into z/Architecture mode after IPL.
    This is handled automatically by all z/Architecture operating systems.
<dt><code>DEVTMAX -1 &#124 0 &#124 1-n</code>
<dd>specifies the maximum number of device threads allowed.
    <p>Specify <code>-1</code> to cause 'one time only' temporary threads to be
    created to service each I/O request to a device. Once the I/O request is
    complete, the thread exits. Subsequent I/O to the same device will cause
    another worker thread to be created again.
    <p>Specify <code>0</code> to cause an unlimited number of 'semi-permanent'
    threads to be created on an 'as-needed' basis. With this option, a thread
    is created to service an I/O request for a device if one doesn't already
    exist, but once the I/O is complete, the thread enters an idle state waiting
    for new work. If a new I/O request for the device arrives before the timeout
    period expires, the existing thread will be reused. The timeout value is
    currently hard coded at 5 minutes. Note that this option can cause one thread
    (or possibly more) to be created for each device defined in your
    configuration. Specifying <code>0</code> means there is no limit to the
    number of threads that can be created.
    <p>Specify a value from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> to set an upper limit
    to the number of threads that can be created to service any I/O request to
    any device. Like the <code>0</code> option, each thread, once done servicing
    an I/O request, enters an idle state. If a new request arrives before the
    timeout period expires, the thread is reused. If all threads are busy when
    a new I/O request arrives however, a new thread is created <i>only</i> if the
    specified maximum has not yet been reached. If the specified maximum number
    of threads has already been reached, then the I/O request is placed in a queue
    and will be serviced by the first available thread (i.e. by whichever thread
    becomes idle first). This option was created to address a threading issue
    (possibly related to the cygwin Pthreads implementation) on Windows systems.
    <p>The default for Windows is <code>8</code>. The default for all other systems
    is <code>0</code>.
<dt><code>PGMPRDOS RESTRICTED &#124 LICENSED</code>
<dd>specifies whether or not Hercules will run licensed program product ESA
    or z/Architecture operating systems.  Specify <code>RESTRICTED</code> to
    make Hercules emulate an IFL (Integrated Facility for Linux) CPU. With
    this specified, licensed ESA or z/Architecture OSes will refuse to
    start. OS/390 and z/OS will enter an A7A wait state, with reason code 7,
    at IPL time.  Specify <code>LICENSED</code> to allow these operating
    systems to run normally. This parameter has no effect on Linux/390,
    Linux for z/Series, or any 370-mode OS.
    <p><b>NOTE: It is <em>YOUR</em> responsibility to comply with the terms
    of your license for the software you intend to run on Hercules. If you
    specify LICENSED and run a licensed operating system in violation of
    that license, then don't come after the Hercules developers when the
    vendor sends his lawyers after you.</b>
    <p><code>RESTRICTED</code> is the default. Specifying
    <code>LICENSED</code> will produce a message at Hercules startup to
    remind you of your responsibility to comply with software license terms.
<dt><code>IODELAY <em>usec</em></code>
<dd>specifies the amount of time (in microseconds) to wait after
    an I/O interrupt is ready to be set pending.  This value can also be
    set using the Hercules console.  The purpose of this parameter is to
    bypass a bug in the <b>Linux/390</b> and <b>zLinux</b> <code>dasd.c</code>
    device driver. The problem is more apt to happen under Hercules than
    on a real machine because we may present an I/O interrupt sooner than a
    real machine.  This problem is being pursued with IBM linux. Meanwhile,
    if <code>OSTAILOR LINUX</code> is specified, then this value defaults to
    <em>800</em> otherwise the value defaults to <em>0</em>.
<dt><code>CODEPAGE <em>codepage</em></code>
<dd>specifies the codepage conversion table used for ascii/ebcdic translation
    "default" specifies traditional hercules codepage, "437/037",
    "437/500" and "850/273" are also supported.
    Iconv single byte codepages may also be used. (eg."UTF8/EBCDIC-CP-NL")
    If no codepage is specified then the environment variable HERCULES_CP
    will be inspected.  The default codepage used is "default"
<dt><code>ECPSVM YES &#124 <em>NO</em> &#124 LEVEL nn</code>
<dd>specifies whether ECPS:VM (Extended Control Program Support : Virtual Machine)
    support is to be enabled. If <em>YES</em> is specified, then the support
    level reported to the operating system is <em>20</em>. The purpose of
    ECPS:VM is to provide to the VM/370 Operating system a set of shortcut
    facilities to perform hypervisor functions (CP Assists) and virtual
    machine simulation (VM Assists). Although this feature does not affect
    VM Operating system products operating in XA, ESA or z/Architecture mode,
    it will affect VM/370 and VM/SP products running under VM/XA, VM/ESA or z/VM.
    Running VM/370 and VM/SP products under VM/XA, VM/ESA or z/VM should be
    done with ECPS:VM disabled. ECPS:VM should not be enabled in an AP or MP
    environment. ECPS:VM has no effect on non-VM operating systems. It is
    however recommended to disable ECPS:VM when running native non-VM operating
    systems. If a specific LEVEL is specified, this value will be reported 
    to the operating system when it issues a Store ECPS:VM level, but it
    doesn't otherwise alter the ECPS:VM facility operations. This is a partial
    implementation.
<dt><code>LDMOD <em>module list</em></code>
<dd>specifies additional modules that are to be loaded by the hercules dynamic loader.
The search order is the default DLL search path. Most systems also support absolute filenames (ie names starting with '/' or '.') in which case the default search path is not taken.
<br>Multiple LDMOD statements may be used.
</dl>
<p>
A comment preceded by a pound sign may be appended to any system
parameter statement.
<h3>Device records</h3>
<p>
The remaining statements in the configuration file are device records.
There must be one device record for each I/O device or group of identical I/O devices.
The format of the device record is:
<p><code><em>devnums devtype</em> [<em>arguments</em>]</code>
<p>where:
<dl>
<dt><code><em>devnums</em></code>
<dd>is either a single <em>devnum</em>, a range of <em>devnum</em> (separated by a '-'),
    a count of <em>devnum</em> (separated by a '.') or a comma separated list
    of <em>devnums</em>.
    Examples would be 200-210 or 0300.10 or 0400,0403 or 0100,0110-011F.
    All devices defined when <em>devnums</em> specifies more than one device
    have identical caracteristics (except for the device number itself).
    All devices defined as a group must be defined on a single channel.
    A channel is defined as a contiguous group of 256 (or hexadecimal 100) devices.
    0010 and 0020 are on the same channels. 0100 and 0210 are not.
    See <em>devnum</em> below for an explanation of how each device number is specified.
<dt><code><em>devnum</em></code>
<dd>is a 1 to 4 digit hexadecimal number, in the range 0000 to FFFF
    (for ESA/390) or 0000 to 0FFF (for S/370).  The device number uniquely
    identifies each device to the operating system.
<dt><code><em>devtype</em></code>
<dd>is the device type.  Valid device types are:

<dt><code><em>arguments</em></code>
<dd>is a list of parameters whose meaning depends on the device type.
    The arguments required for each class of device are shown below.
</dl>
<h3>Arguments required for each device type</h3>
<dl>
<p>
<a name="loc3270">
<dt><em>Local non-SNA 3270 devices</em>
<dd>No arguments are required for this device type.  To use this
    device, a tn3270 client must connect to the host Linux machine
    via the port number specified in the CNSLPORT parameter.
    A valid tn3270 device type, such as IBM-3278, must be used.
    If your tn3270 client software allows you to specify a device
    type suffix (for example, IBM-3278@001F) then you can use the
    suffix to connect the client to a specific device number.
    If no suffix is specified, then the client will be connected
    to the first available 3270 device.
<p>
<a name="conprkb">
<dt><em>Console printer-keyboard devices</em>
<dd>No arguments are required for this device type.  To use this
    device, a telnet client must connect to the host Linux machine
    via the port number specified in the CNSLPORT parameter.
    If your telnet client software allows you to specify a device
    type suffix (for example, ansi@0009) then you can use the
    suffix to connect the client to a specific device number.
    If no suffix is specified, then the client will be connected
    to the first available 1052 or 3215 device. One optional argument
    may be specified: <code>noprompt</code>, if specified, will remove
    the message at the console prompting for input.
<p>
<a name="cardrdr">
<dt><em>Card reader devices</em>
<dd>The argument specifies a list of file names containing card images.
    Additional arguments may be specified after the file names:
    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><code>sockdev</code>
    <dd>indicates the card reader is a socket device wherein the
        filename is actually a socket specification instead of a
        device filename.  When used, there must only be one filename
        specified in the form: <code>port</code> or <code>host:port</code>
        or <code>sockpath/sockname</code>.  The device then accepts
        remote connections on the given TCP/IP port or Unix Domain
        Socket, and reads data from the socket instead of from a device
        file. This allows automatic remote submission of card reader
        data. See the <a href="hercrdr.html">Hercules Socket Reader</a>
        page for more details.
    <dt><code>eof</code>
    <dd>specifies that unit exception status is presented after
        reading the last card in the file. This option is persistent, and
        will remain in effect until the reader is reinitialized with the
        <code>intrq</code> option.
    <dt><code>intrq</code>
    <dd>specifies that unit check status with intervention required
        sense bytes is presented after reading the last card
        in the file. This option is persistent, and will remain in
        effect until the reader is reinitialized with the <code>eof</code>
        option.
    <dt><code>multifile</code>
    <dd>specifies, when multiple input files are entered, to
        automatically open the next input file and continue reading
        whenever EOF is encountered on a given file. If not specified,
        then reading stops once EOF is reached on a given file and
        an attention interrupt is then required to open and begin
        reading the next file.
    <dt><code>ebcdic</code>
    <dd>specifies that the file contains fixed length 80-byte EBCDIC

<a name="tapedev">
<dt><em>Emulated tape devices</em>
<dd>Four types of emulation are supported:
    <dl>
    <p><dt><b>SCSI tapes</b>
    <dd>The argument specifies the tape device name (usually
        <b><i>/dev/st0</i></b>).  SCSI tapes are read and written
        using variable length EBCDIC blocks and filemarks exactly
        like a mainframe tape volume.
    <p><dt><b>Optical Media Attach (OMA) virtual files</b>
    <dd>These are read-only files which usually reside on CDROM.
        OMA virtual tapes consist of one CDROM file corresponding
        to each physical file of the emulated tape.  An ASCII text
        file called the tape descriptor file (TDF) specifies the
        names of the files which make up the virtual tape.
        The argument specifies the name of the tape descriptor
        file (for example <b><i>/cdrom/tapes/uaa196.tdf</i></b>)
        <p>Each file on the virtual tape can be in one of three
        formats:

        </dl>
        <p>If you have any IBM manuals in Bookmanager format on CDROM,

        <b><i>\TAPES</i></b> directory on the CDROM.
    <p><dt><b>AWSTAPE files</b>
    <dd>These contain a complete tape in one file.  AWSTAPE files
        consist of variable length EBCDIC blocks.  Each block is
        preceded by a 6-byte header.  Filemarks are represented by
        a 6-byte header with no data.  This is the same format as is
        used by the P/390.
        The argument specifies the location of the AWSTAPE file
        (for example <b><i>ickdsf.ipl</i></b>)
    <p><dt><b>HET files</b>
    <dd>These contain a complete tape in one file and have the same
        structure as the AWSTAPE format with the added ability to have
        compressed data.
        The first argument specifies the location of the HET file.  The
        filename must end with ".het" to be recognized by Hercules as an
        HET file.
        (for example <b><i>023178.het</i></b>)
        <p>Additional arguments that allow you to control various HET settings
        are:
        <dl>
            <dt><code>AWSTAPE</code>
            <dd>The <b><i>AWSTAPE</i></b> argument causes HET files to
                be written in AWSTAPE format.  This basically, disables
                the additional features provided by the HET format.
            <dt><code>COMPRESS=<em>n</em></code>

                whether compression should be used when writing to HET
                files.  The value <code><em>n</em></code> can be <b>1</b>
                to turn on compression (the default) or <b>0</b> to turn
                it off.  <b><i>IDRC</i></b> is a currently a synonym for
                <b><i>COMPRESS</i></b>, but may be used in the future to
                control other emulated tape drive features.
            <dt><code>METHOD=<em>n</em></code>
            <dd>The <b><i>METHOD</i></b> option allows you to specify
                which compression method to use.  You may specify
                <b><i>1</i></b> for ZLIB compression or <b><i>2</i></b>
                for BZIP2 compression.  The default is <b><i>1</i></b>.
            <dt><code>LEVEL=<em>n</em></code>
            <dd>The <b><i>LEVEL</i></b> option controls the level of
                compression.  It ranges from <b><i>1</i></b> for fastest
                compression to <b><i>9</i></b> for best compression.
                The default is <b><i>4</i></b>.
            <dt><code>CHUNKSIZE=<em>nnnnn</em></code>
            <dd>The <b><i>CHUNKSIZE</i></b> option allows you to create
                                HET files that contain different chunk sizes.  The AWSTAPE
                                (and therefore the HET) format allows each tape block to be
                                logically broken up into smaller chunks.  For instance, if
                                your S/3x0 application creates tapes with a block size of
                                27998, those blocks would be broken down into
                                <code><em>nnnnn</em></code> sized chunks.  To be honest, I
                                can't think of a reason you'd want to change this since
                                decreasing it may reduce compression performance, but it's
                                there if you want it.  The range is from <b><i>4096</i></b>
                                to <b><i>65535</i></b>.  The latter being the default.
        <p />
    </dl>
    <dl>
        The following parameters apply to both AWS and HET emulation files :
        <p />
        <dt><code>MAXSIZE</code>|<code>MAXSIZEK</code>|<code>MAXSIZEM</code>=<em>n</em>
        <dd>Specifies the maximum number of bytes (specified in bytes, Kilobytes or Megabytes) for the emulated file. This parameter defaults to 0, meaning there is no limit on the file size.
        <dt><code>EOTMARGIN</code>=<em>n</em>
        <dd>Specifies the number of bytes remaining before reaching <em>maxsize</em> at which point the tape device will signal the presence of the 'End Of Tape' marker, thus allowing the program to switch to the next tape.
        <p />
    </dl>
    <dl>
        Additionally, if the file name starts with the '@' character (at sign), the file really describes a list of tape emulation files to be loaded in succession.
        <br />The syntax of each line is identical to the information specified that can be specified after the device type when the emulation file is specified directly after the device type in the configuration file.
        <br />If the emulation file filename in the file list is the '*' character, then this specifies a set of options to be applied to all additional emulation files specified in the file list.
        <br />Parameters are appended in succession. In all cases, is the same parameter is specified more than once, the last instance takes precedence.
        <br />
        Therefore, it is possible to specify a set of parameters in the base configuration file, Another set on a '*' line, and another set for each individual lines. Parameter are then appended in that order.

        An SCSI tape device should *NOT* be given in a file list.

        (Note: The CTCI protocol is only for the Linux version of
        Hercules. For Windows, use the below CTCI protocol instead).
    <p><dt><b>CTCI</b>  &nbsp; &nbsp; (Channel to Channel link to Win32 TCP/IP stack)<p>
    <dd>A modified Win32 version of the CTCI protocol for the Windows

        <dl>
            <dt><code><em>lport</em></code>
            <dd>specifies the local TCP port. This is the TCP port that

            <dt><code><em>rhost</em></code>
            <dd>specifies the remote host. This is the name or IP address

        </dl>
        Note : CTCT currently only supports IP traffic, so it cannot be used to

    <P><dt><b>LCS</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; (LAN Channel Station Emulation)<p>
    <dd>An emulated Lan Channel Station Adapter.
    This emulation mode appears to the operating system running in
    the Hercules machine as an IBM 8232 LCS device, an IBM 2216
    router, a 3172 running ICP (Interconnect Communications Program),
    the LCS3172 driver of a P/390, or an IBM Open Systems Adapter.
        <br>
    Rather than a point-to-point link, this emulation creates a
    virtual ethernet adapter through which the guest operating system
    running in the Hercules machine can communicate. As such, this
    mode is not limited to TCP/IP traffic, but in fact will handle
    any ethernet frame.
    <p>
    A single device should be declared for all LCS device numbers. The LCS
    emulator will create all the additional devices necessary for LCS operations.
    Also, the 1st declared device should be an even numbered device.
    The configuration statement for LCS is as follows:
    <p>
    NOTE :<br>
    There are no required parameters for the LCS emulation, however
    there are several options that can be specified on the config

For IP modes, the entry specific information is as follows:
<dd>
<dt><code><em>PRI|SEC|NO</em></code><dd> specifies where a packet with an unknown IP
address is forwarded to. PRI is the primary
default entry, SEC specifies the entry to use

     <dt><code><em>nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</code></em><dd>specifies the home IP address

     <dt>When the operation mode is IP, specify only the even (read)
     device number <em>dev</em>. The odd (write) address will be create automatically.
     <p>

     Note: SNA is currently <em>NOT</em> implemented.
          <p>

          Additionally, two other statements can be included in the
          address translation file. The HWADD and ROUTE statements.
          <p>

          Use the HWADD to specify a hardware (MAC) address for a
          virtual adapter. The first parameter after HWADD specifies
          with relative adapter for which the address is applied.
          <p>

          The ROUTE statement is included for convenience. This allows the
          hercifc program to create a network route for this specified
          virtual adapter. Please note that it is not necessary to include
          point-to-point routes for each IP address in the table. This is
          done automatically by the emulation module.
          <p>

          Up to 4 virtual (relative) adapters 00-03 are currently supported.

    <em>When CKD DASD images are spread across multiple files, you must
    specify only the first file name (the file with suffix _1) in the
    configuration statement!</em>
    <p>
    If your operating system supports <i>large file sizes</i> or
    <i>64 bit offsets</i> then volumes larger than 2G can be kept
    in a single file.
    <p>
    Alternatively, the argument may specify the name of a file containing
    a compressed CKD DASD image.  The CKD driver will automatically detect
    whether the file contains a regular CKD image or a compressed CKD
    image.  Refer to the <a href="cckddasd.html">CCKD</a> page for details
    on how to create and use compressed CKD DASD images.
    <p>
    If you specify an INET address the format is:
    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><code><em>ip-name-or-addr:port:devnum</em></code>
    <dd><i>ip-name-or-addr</i> specifies the internet name or address
        where the Hercules shared device server is running.
    <p>
    <dd><i>port</i> specifies the port number the shared device server
        is listening on.  If omitted, the default is 3990.
    <p>
    <dd><i>devnum</i> specifies the device number on the shared
        device server.  If omitted, the default is the current device number.

    <dt><em>Communication Adapter</em>
    <dd>
    Describes a BSC emulation line entry to either link 2 hercules engines
    or a custom made program emulating a 2780, 3780 or 3x74, or a custom made
    program interfacing to a real BSC line.
    <p />
    The communication is emulated over a TCP connection. All bytes are 
    transfered as-is (except for doubling DLE in transparent mode) just
    like it would over a real BSC link. Emulated EIA (DCD, DTR, CTS,
    etc..) or X.21/V.11 leads (C, T, etc..) are treated differently depending
    on the DIAL option selected.
    <p />
    The line emulates a point-to-point BSC link. There is no point-to-multipoint handling.
    <p />
    The following options define the line emulation behaviour :
    <dl>
        <dt><code>DIAL=IN|OUT|INOUT|NO</code><dd>
        Specifies call direction (if any). If <em>DIAL=NO</em> is specified, the
        TCP outgoing connection is attempted as soon as an 'ENABLE' CCW is executed.
        Also, in this mode, an incoming connection will always be accepted. If <em>DIAL=IN|INOUT</em>
        is specified, a TCP incoming call is accepted ONLY if an 'ENABLE' CCW is currently
        executing on the device. If <em>DIAL=OUT</em>, the 'ENABLE' CCW is rejected.
        When <em>DIAL=IN|INOUT</em> is specified, a DIAL CCW allows the application
        to establish a TCP connection to a specific host. For other DIAL values,
        the DIAL CCW is rejected.
        <dt><code>lhost=hostname|ip address|<em>*</em></code>
        <dd>Specifies which IP address to listen on. This also conditions the network
        interface from which incoming calls will be accepted. Specifying '*' means
        all incoming TCP calls are accepted, regardless of the destination IP
        address or call origin. This is the default value. Specifying a specific
        IP address when <em>DIAL=OUT</em> is specified has no effect.
        <dt><code>lport=service name|port number</code>
        <dd>Specifies the TCP port for which to listen to incoming TCP calls. This
        value is mandatory for <em>DIAL=IN|INOUT|NO</em>. It is ignored for <em>DIAL=OUT</em>.
        <dt><code>rhost=hostname|ip address</code>
        <dt><code>rport=service name|port number</code>
        <dd>Specifies the remote host and port to which to direct a TCP connection on a 
        DIAL=NO line when an 'ENABLE' CCW is executed. This option is mandatory when <em>DIAL=NO</em>
        is specified. It is ignored for other <em>DIAL</em> values.
        <dt>The following options are tuning options. In most cases, using the default values
        give the best results
        <dt><code>rto=0|-1|nnn|<em>3000</em></code>
        <dd>Specifies the number of miliseconds before terminating a read on a timeout, when
        no read termination control character is received. Specifying 0 means the READ ends
        immediatly. -1 specifies there is no timeout.
        <dt><code>pto=0|-1|nnn|<em>3000</em></code>
        <dd>Specifies the number of miliseconds before terminating a POLL on a timeout, when
        no ACK or NACK sequence is received. Specifying 0 means the POLL ends
        immediatly. -1 specifies there is no timeout.
        <dt><code>eto=0|<em>-1</em>|nnn|<em>10000</em></code>
        <dd>Specifies the number of miliseconds before terminating an ENABLE operation on a timeout.
        the timeout applies when <em>DIAL=NO|IN|INOUT</em> is specified, the outgoing TCP call fails (<em>DIAL=NO</em>)
        and there is no previously or currently established TCP connection for this line. When <em>DIAL=NO</em> is
        specified, the timeout defaults to 10 seconds. for <em>DIAL=IN|INOUT</em>, the timeout
        defaults to -1.
