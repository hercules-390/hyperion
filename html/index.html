<h1>The Hercules System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture Emulator</h1>
<hr noshade>
<p>
Hercules is an open source software implementation of the mainframe
System/370 and ESA/390 architectures, in addition to the new 64-bit
z/Architecture.
Hercules runs under Linux, Windows 98, Windows NT, and Windows 2000.
<p>
Hercules was created by Roger Bowler and is maintained by Jay Maynard.
Jan Jaeger designed and implemented many of the advanced features of
Hercules, including dynamic reconfiguration, integrated console,
interpretive execution and z/Architecture support.

<blockquote>

The complete source code for the current <i>development</i> version of
Hercules is also available via anonymous access from our cvs source code
repository. The cvs root is
<b>CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.conmicro.cx:/usr/cvs/hercules</b>. Doing a
checkout on module "hercules" will get you the source for all of Hercules,
and checking out "wingui" will get you the complete source for the <a
href="http://home.sprintmail.com/~dtrout/Hercules/index.html"> Windows
GUI</a> front end (HercGUI).

<p>

No password is required; just press enter when asked:

<blockquote><blockquote><p><tt>
	cvs login<br>
	(Logging in to anonymous@conmicro.cx...)<br>
	CVS password:<br>
	cvs -z9 co hercules<br>
	cvs server: Updating hercules<br>
</tt></blockquote></blockquote>

Please note that this will get you the current
<i><u>development</u></i> version of Hercules, which is <i>not</i>
release quality and thus might not even work (since it's still under
development). If you want the current, stable, <i>release</i> version
of Hercules (i.e. one that is known to work properly), then use the
previously mentioned links instead.

<p>

Read the file <tt>README.CVS</tt> for additional and updated
	    instructions for building the development version.

<em>&#147;
Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to see OS
running on a machine that I personally own.
Hercules is a marvelous tool.  My thanks to you all for a job
very well done.

<em>&#147;
I do miss my mainframe a lot, and playing with Herc sure brings back
memories.  Just seeing the IBM message prefixes, and responding to
console messages again was a wonderful bit of nostalgia!

I have installed your absolutely fantastic /390 emulator.
You won't believe what I felt when I saw the prompt.
