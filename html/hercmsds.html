ESA/390, and z/Architecture emulator utility program <code>dasdisup</code>.
<h3>Messages</h3>
<dl class="messages">
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS001E">
HHCDS001E Cannot obtain storage for member array: <em>error</em>
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>An attempt to obtain storage for the array of SYS1.SVCLIB members
failed. The error is described by <code><em>error</em></code>.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Correct the error and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function main
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS002I">
HHCDS002I End of directory: <em>count</em> members selected
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The end of the SYS1.SVCLIB directory has been reached.
<code><em>count</em></code> members have been selected for processing.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function main
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS003E">
HHCDS003E Directory block byte count is invalid
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The length of the directory block read is invalid. The SYS1.SVCLIB
directory is probably corrupt.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Rebuild SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function process_dirblk
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS004E">
HHCDS004E Number of members exceeds MAX_MEMBERS
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>SYS1.SVCLIB has too many members to fit in the array used to store
their information.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Increase the value of MAX_MEMBERS in <code>dasdisup.c</code> and
recompile the program, then run it again.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function process_dirblk
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS005E">
HHCDS005E Member <em>member</em> TTR count is zero
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The member named <code><em>member</em></code> has no data associated
with it. Since aliases have been skipped already, this means
that the SYS1.SVCLIB directory is corrupt.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Rebuild SYS1.SVCLIB and run <code>dasdisup</code> again.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function process_dirblk
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS006W">
HHCDS006W Member <em>member</em> is not single text record
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The member named <code><em>member</em></code> is not contained in a single
text record. This is an invalid condition. The member will be skipped
later, and message <a href="#HHCDS011E">HHCDS011E</a> will be issued.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>If this member must be processed, rebuild SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun
<code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function process_dirblk
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS007W">
HHCDS007W Member <em>member</em> size <em>size</em> exceeds X'7F8' bytes
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The member named <code><em>member</em></code> is too long. The maximum length of
an OS/360 SVC load module is X'7F8' (2040 decimal) bytes. The member will
be processed, but OS/360 will have problems with it.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Correct the member in SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function process_dirblk
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS008W">
HHCDS008W Member <em>member</em> size <em>size</em> is not a multiple of 8
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The member named <code><em>member</em></code> is not a multiple of 8 bytes long. Its
actual size is <code><em>size</em></code>. This is not valid for an OS/360
load module. OS/360 will issue an ABEND when an attempt is made to
load the module.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Correct the member in SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function process_dirblk
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS009I">
HHCDS009I Alias <em>alias</em> skipped
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The alias named <code><em>alias</em></code> has been skipped, since no processing is
necessary for it.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function resolve_xctltab
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS010I">
HHCDS010I Member <em>member</em> skipped
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The member named <code><em>member</em></code> has been skipped, since it does not
have an XCTL table.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>If the member should have an XCTL table, rebuild it
in SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function resolve_xctltab
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS011E">
HHCDS011E Member <em>member</em> has multiple text records
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The member named <code><em>member</em></code> has multiple text records. This
is not a valid condition for an OS/360 SVC module. The member will not
be processed. Message <a href="#HHCDS006W">HHCDS006W</a> was issued for
this member earlier.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>If this member must be processed, rebuild it
in SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function resolve_xctltab

<dt><code><a name="HHCDS012E">
HHCDS012E Member <em>member</em> has invalid TTR <em>ttr</em>
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The pointer to the text record for the member named <code><em>member</em></code>
is invalid. The pointer found is <code><em>ttr</em></code>. The member cannot be located
to be processed. The SYS1.SVCLIB directory is probably corrupt.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Rebuild SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function resolve_xctltab
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS013I">
HHCDS013I Processing member <em>member</em> text record TTR=<em>ttr</em>
CCHHR=<em>cchhr</em>
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The member named <code><em>member</em></code> is being processed. Its relative
location is <code><em>ttr</em></code>, and its absolute location is <code><em>cchhr</em></code>.
  <dt>Issued by

  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS015E">
HHCDS015E Member <em>member</em> TTR <em>ttr</em> text record length
<em>length</em> is not valid 
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The length <code><em>length</em></code> of the text record at location <code><em>ttr</em></code>
of the member named <code><em>member</em></code> is less than 8, greater than 1024,
or not a multiple of 8. All of these conditions must be met for the
length to be valid. The member is probably corrupt.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Rebuild the member in SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
  <dt>Issued by
  <dd>dasdisup.c, function resolve_xctltab
  </dl>
<dt><code><a name="HHCDS016E">
HHCDS016E Member <em>member</em> TTR <em>ttr</em> text record length
<em>textlength</em> does not match length <em>dirlength</em> in directory
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The length <code><em>textlength</em></code> of the text record at location
<code><em>ttr</em></code> is not the same as the length <code><em>dirlength</em></code> in the
directory entry for member <code><em>member</em></code>. Either the member, or the
directory, is probably corrupt.
  <dt>Action
  <dd>Rebuild the member in SYS1.SVCLIB and rerun <code>dasdisup</code>.
If this does not correct the problem, rebuild SYS1.SVCLIB in its entirety.
  <dt>Issued by

<dt><code><a name="HHCDS017E">
HHCDS017E Member <em>member</em> TTR <em>ttr</em> XCTL table
improperly terminated
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The XCTL table in member <code><em>member</em></code> at location <code><em>ttr</em></code> runs

</code>(<code>Alias</code>|<code>Member</code>)<code> skipped
</a></code>
<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>The member or alias named <code><em>member</em></code> is not an Open, Close,
or EOV module, and so does not have an XCTL table that needs to be
updated. It has been skipped.

<dd><dl>
  <dt>Meaning
  <dd>A reference to the member named <code><em>reference</em></code> in the
member named <code><em>member</em></code> was found, The referenced member is at the
location <code><em>ttrl</em></code> in the table. <code><em>status</em></code> is optional; it may
be one of:
    <dl>
    <dt><code>** Member <em>reference</em> not found</code>
    <dd>The referenced member was not found in
SYS1.SVCLIB. The reference cannot be updated.
    <dt><code>replaced by TTRL=<em>newttrl</em> <em>flag</em></code>
    <dd> The reference was updated to point to the referenced member's
actual location at <code><em>newttrl</em></code>. If <code><em>flag</em></code> is
<code>****</code>, the actual length of the referenced member is different
from the length of the member in the reference pointer.
