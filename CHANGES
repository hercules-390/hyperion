21 Nov 2010 Corrected DIAGNOSE X'000' to report timezone differential - Harold Grovesteen
28 Oct 2010 MAINSIZE and XPNDSIZE UNLOCKED and LOCKED options - Mark L. Gaubatz
            LOCKED option indicates memory is to be locked into storage while
            UNLOCKED indicates memory is not locked into storage. The default is
            UNLOCKED.

            Note: Hercules preserves the last locking state of MAINSIZE and
            XPNDSIZE. Consequently, once storage is locked, any change to a
            storage size will honor the existing lock state of memory unless
            the lock state (UNLOCKED or LOCKED) is specified on the new MAINSIZE
            or XPNDSIZE command.

            CAUTION: Do not lock main storage or expanded storage unless
            sufficient real memory is available to back the request. Failure to
            do so may require host system reboot to recover.

17 Sep 2010 Enhanced Monitor Facility - Jan Jaeger
16 Sep 2010 Message Security Assist Extension 3 - Bernard van der Helm
14 Sep 2010 1) Set Subsystem Mode support (treats SSM the same way the 2105 does,
               mostly validate and NOP). There is still one validation sequence to
               be added, but can be done later (marked TBD). Future support can be
               added for changes to subsystem caching by dynamically changing
               SYNCIO to NOSYNCIO; position marked in the update as TBD/Future.
            2) Move of sense length to CU type where it belongs, rather than by
               device type; new code in ckddasd.c turns on 24-bit compatibility
               sense for 3380 devices when attached to newer controllers.
            3) Update of CKD RDC features and documentation of feature bits.
               Device features corrected to reflect Hercules supported and
               unsupported CKD features.

            that produces incorrect output under Linux due to libtool
            wrappers - Kevin Leonard
29 Aug 2010 Virtual Architecture Level support - Jan Jaeger
28 Aug 2010 Add "autoinit" command to control a sysblk variable noautoinit.
            sysblk.noautoinit = FALSE, devinit will create a file when requested
            file is not found, write 2 TMs and rewind the file.
            sysblk.noautoinit = TRUE, devinit will fail the open when requested
            file is not found.
            "autoinit" sets with [on|off] - default is off. "off" means
            sysblk.noautoinit = TRUE.
            New message HHC00235I is displayed when a tape file is created. - Paul Gorlinsky
28 Aug 2010 Move update_maxrates_hwm() from panel.c and dyngui.c to timer.c to
            correct update of maxrates when daemon mode is enabled without a
            GUI interface being used. Previous maxrates will not be displayed if a
            prior interval has not occurred. Current maxrates will be displayed
            during shutdown. - Paul Gorlinsky
26 Aug 2010 Add "midnight" option to maxrates. Sets interval to 1440 and
            curr_int_start_time to the prior midnight. This will cause
            the maxrates stats to print at midnight.
            "impl.c" was modified to set curr_int_start_time to the
            previous midnight if the interval is 1440 minutes. - Paul Gorlinsky

            Harold Grovesteen
08 Aug 2010 Load/Store-on-Condition Facility - Roger Bowler
05 Aug 2010 CMDSEP function added. Default is off. The characters
            '.', '!' and '-' are invalid. Setting the character to a '#'
            could have unexpected results if the command line attempted to
            include a trailing comment.        Paul Gorlinsky
            Type 'help cmdsep' for a description of the command.

04 Aug 2010 Display maxrates when interval expires. Paul Gorlinsky

22 Jul 2010 Add code page mapping 1252/1140 - Kevin Leonard

21 Jul 2010 QUERY and SET have been changed to individual commands:

            These have been replaced with individual commands:

            qstor
            qcpuid
            qproc
            qports
            qlpar
            qpfkeys

            emsg [ on | off | text | time ]

            quitmout [n]


21 Jul 2010 PF KEY support enhancement. New variable '&*'. '&*' represents all of the remaining tokens
            beyond the last subtitution variable used. This is a recursive implementation. A single space
            is added between each token. Token can be enclosed in paired single or double quotes. Quotes
            are included as part of the token string.

            New variable '&$' represents the data remaining on the line past token number 9. Token '&*'
            does include the data from the '&$' token.

            For example:
            DEFSYM PF02 "SUBST DELAY herc devinit &0 &*"

            Typing >580 "HET_TAPE.HET" RO
            and pressing PF2 would place
                   herc devinit 580 "HET_TAPE.HET" RO
            on the command line.

            It is possible to use '&*' more than once as with any substitution place holder.
            If the command line had X Y Z A B C on it and the PF string was herc devinit &0 &* &1 &* &2
            the result would be herc devinit X Y Z A B C Y Z A B C Z
19 Jul 2010 PF Key support enhancement.
            DEFSYM PFnn -

                                         .-DELAY-.
            >>--DEFSYM--PFnn--.-------.--+-------+--.-------------.-><
                              '-SUBST-'  '-IMMED-'  ' <-pfdata-<  '

            Operands
            PFnn
                identifies the PF Key you are defining; the operand nn is a
                number from 01 to 48.

            SUBST
                indicates that the PF data might contain substitution place holders.

                The place holder is identified by an ampersand (&) followed by a decimal
                number from 0 to 9.

                If two ampersands ('&&') are detected, then a single ampersand is substituted.

            DELAY
            IMMED
                indicates when the PF is processed. If you specify DELAY, then PF data is displayed
                on the command line when you press the PF key. The data may then be modified if
                necessary. Press the 'RETURN' key to process. If you specify IMMED, then PF data is
                processed when you press the PK key.

            pfdata
                defines the command that you want processed.

              For example:
            DEFSYM PF02 "SUBST herc help &0"

            Type QUERY on the command line and press PF02.
            The string "herc help query" will be built on the command line. Press RETURN to execute.

            Windows has PF1 - PF48; Other PF1-20; Other implementations depend on an xterm terminal type.

17 Jul 2010 Add two additional default symbols MODPATH and MODNAME representing the
            pathname and the module name of the startup program.
16 Jul 2010 Begin Function Keys (PF1-12) Support. PF1 defaults to HELP.
            Use DEFSYM command to set PF keys. DEFSYM PF01 HELP . You must include the ZERO
            as part of the name of the first 9 function keys. PF01-PF12.
            You must also include the command target, "herc", "pscp" or "scp" as a prefix to
            the command. DEFSYM PF12 "pscp netstat -a" for example.

14 Jul 2010 Enhance devlist to display a single class of devices.
13 Jul 2010 New startup option (-s) to define symbols at startup. Format: '-s sym=Value'
            This can be done recursively.
12 Jul 2010 Add lock on configuration file to prevent duplicate disk/tape files from being opened.
11 Jul 2010 Add checks for a valid CNSLPORT. If 1st char of port is numeric all must be numeric
            and in the range of 0-65535. If the first char is not numeric, no checks are made.
09 Jul 2010 Add DIR/LS commands as appropriate. Add "mt" command for Mag tape control.
            Command mt supports rew, fsf, bsf, fsr, bsr, asf and wtm sub functions.
            Type "help mt" for more information.
08 Jul 2010 Add code page mappings 819/037, 819/037v2, 1252/037, 1252/037v2 - Kevin Leonard
08 Jul 2010 Add FAKETAPE support in hetupd and hetget. (autogen.sh and ./configure rerun required)
06 Jul 2010 Add FTLIB.C FakeTape library; add support in hetmap and hetinit for
            FAKETAPE.
22 Jun 2010 CAPPING feature. Capping can be set in hercules.cnf with the keyword
            CAPPING and a number, representing the maximum MIPS for CPs. Capping
            does not apply to specialty engines.
15 Jun 2010 'QUIT' processing has changed. The 'cmdlevel' is defaulting to
            operator, maintenance and programmer. If 'quit' is entered and
            developer is not enabled then 'quit' will check for any active
            cpu. If an active cpu is found, a message is presented indicating
            that the system is running. A second message is then presented
            asking for confirmation by entering a 2nd 'quit' command.
            If 'cmdlevel +developer' has been entered, then 'quit' stops
            hercules immediately. 'qquit' has been removed.
13 Jun 2010 'EXCPs' tag has been changed to 'IO'.
13 Jun 2010 'QUIT' will now only ask for 2nd quit if any processor is active.
            New message added indicating that the machine is not quiesced.
13 Jun 2010 The 60 seconds for QUIT and SSD has been replaced by #define
            QUITTIME_PERIOD and is now defaulted to 10 seconds.
08 Jun 2010 'scpimply' and 'scpecho' use ON/OFF now instead of being a toggle.
03 Jun 2010 'scpimply' command and function added. 'Unknown' commands are passed to the
            scp for processing, if the scp has enabled scp operator commands.
03 Jun 2010 MAXCPU is reset to NUMCPU if NUMCPU exceeds MAXCPU; Warning message issued.
03 Jun 2010 QQUIT added for cmdlevels above SYSOPER. (Quick QUIT)
26 May 2010 QUERY command and enhancements. See QUERY HELP for assistance
25 May 2010 Add EXCP counts to all devices
20 May 2010 QUIT and SSD require 2nd command within 60 seconds.
12 May 2010 Addition of a native Windows Threading Model (wthreads) enabled with
            OPTION_WTHREADS. Requires WIN2K and later. Disables PTTRACE.
08 May 2010 HERCULES_LIB is introduced as an environment variable for LOADABLE
            MODULES DIRECTORY.
            Default library after processing startup arguments is:
            1) -p highest priority
            2) HERCULES_LIB is 2nd priority
            3) MODULESDIR define is 3rd priority
            4) Final Default is determined by attempting to use path where startup program
               was found and if it is not resolved the "hercules" is used.   - Paul G.
07 May 2010 Changes to selecting default Loadable Modules Directory. - Paul G.
            The default directory selection has been change to use the directory
            that hercules was started from if define MODULESDIR was not set.
            Unless no path is available, then hercules will be used.
07 May 2010 Functions basename() and dirname() are required and use the libdef.h header. (not windows)
11 Apr 2010 Fix SCSI tape dev-attn failure if read-only media is mounted - Fish
29 Mar 2010 Add support for cmdlevel to limit console commands to the requested

18 Mar 2010 Windows changes. Add handlers for CTRL-C, CTRL-Break, CLOSE, SHUTDOWN
            and LOGOFF. CTRL-C does not do anything (yet), CTRL-Break simulates the
            External Interrupt Key being pressed, CLOSE, SHUTDOWN and LOGOFF all
            initate an immediate shutdown of hercules in order to close all files
            correctly. An orderly SHUTDOWN is not possible for the GUEST OS because
            Windows allows just 5 seconds to complete any cleanup (when using the
            cmd terminal interface). - Paul G.
16 Mar 2010 Panel changed to add MIPS and SIOS to bottom status line. MIPS and SIOS
            are displayed if window is width >= 104. MIPS is displayed if window
            width >= 90. If window width < 90 then neither is displayed. - Paul G.
15 Mar 2010 Expanded w32util hosting information when using VS2008 and MS SDK 7.0
            Code will not expand if less than VS2008. If VS2008 is used, then
            MS SDK 7.0 must be installed. Updates to winNT.h are in MS SDK 7.0 for
            Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. - Paul G.
15 Mar 2010 Message cleanup, change CPUxxxx to CPxx where CP is the indicated
            processor type. CP, CF, AP, IL and IP. "IE" is used to indicate SIE
            keeping message similar. - Paul G.

27 Mar 2006 SCSI tape fixes (MAJOR COMMIT):  (Fish)
             1) serialize open/close processing
             2) support "YES" as valid AUTO_SCSI_MOUNT specification
                (uses default interval value, currently 5 seconds)
             3) "scsimount" panel command:
                 a) support '0' and 'yes'
                 b) don't issue "no active mount requests"
                    for tape drives without display feature
                 c) fix mount/unmount request detection
             4) process 'rewind' option at CLOSE, not open (oops)
             5) add devnum (with LCSS prefix) to most messages
             6) attempt to fix *nix issue of 'EOF' status not being set
                when BSR/FSR spaces over a tapemark
             7) reset 'blockid' to -1 and remove redundant update
                status call in BSF/FSF.
             8) reset 'curfilen' to 0 in rewind_scsitape (and 'blockid'
                to -1 if rewind fails)
             9) fix erase-gap and data-security-erase functions
                so they actually return an i/o status
            10) start automount thread (if AUTO_SCSI_MOUNT is specified)
                when tape is determined to be not mounted regardless
                of whether drive/device-type has display-feature
            11) remove premature open_scsitape call in tapedev_init_handler
                to reinstate original behavior of not opening the tape until
                needed by tapedev CCW processing (PR# tape/18 "slow startup")
            12) in an effort to reduce the impact of slow tape status
                retrieval (that in addition to the above premature call
                to open_scsitape (which calls update_status_scsitape)
                was what was causing PR# tape/18 "slow startup"), a new
                tape status worker thread retrieval technique was designed
                which allows specifying a timeout value completely different
                from whatever one the host o/s may use (if any).
            13) change message text in 'load_display' function to be more
                technically accurate and fix ReqAutoMount mount/unmount
                request detection to correct bogus mount/unmount messages
            14) add support for Windows tape device names ("\\.\Tape0")
            15) use blockid (as returned by Read Block Id CCW) *as-is*
                in LOCATE BLOCK CCW,
            16) complete rewrite/overhaul of w32stape.c:
               a) remove rewind logic from open
                  (now done by 'close_scsitape')
               b) properly track positioning status and setting of
                  errno values after each i/o so that accuracy of
                  device status & errno can be relied upon (e.g.
                  BOT/EOF/EOT/EOD can now be properly detected)
               c) BSF/BSR fixed to move BACKWARDS, not forwards (oops)
               d) fix Read Block Id logic (MTIOCPOS) to return a more
                  technically accurate position value (the actual one)
            17) many minor editorial corrections (remove TRACE stmts, etc)
